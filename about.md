I am a 4th year student at Brigham Young University. I am currently working towards a degree in Computer Science with an Emphasis in Animation. I currently work as a Perforce Engineer and Production Pipeline Engineer on BYU's senior game capstone (also general gameplay programming). Most of my experience is in Unreal Engine (Blueprints and C++), but I'm comfortable in Java, C#, and Python. I am half Chinese and half Lao, and I speak English, Thai, and Lao.
