<!-- # Shrineflow -->
Since April 2023, I've been working on BYU's senior game capstone, a year-long project that simulates the operations of actual studios. This game, which has the temp name "Shrineflow", is an asymetrical game of chase between a ninja that hides around the map and collects objectives and a fox sorceress (kitsune) that has to catch the ninja. We'll work on it until April 2024.

## Design and Iteration
Since April 2023, a small team and I rapidly iterated over the game to make it where it is today. There has been many things that have greatly changed since we started working on it, including character abilities, game objectives, and many other concepts. All of these changes came from extensive playtesting, both internal and external. We're very excited about where the game is right now!

## Programming
Prototyping was done in bluprints for quick implementation and iteration. However, after the game was in a good place, we wanted to make a seperate project that wouldn't have all the residual cruft. In the "Stable Build", we're using much better practices, like implementing complex computations in C++ and using Unreal's Gameplay Ability System.
