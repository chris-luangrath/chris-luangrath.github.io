* [link](https://www.rendereverything.com/automatic-material-creation-in-unreal-engine-with-python/)
* Worked together with Environments to make a tool that helps artists import meshes into Unreal with good materials
* It checks the meshes in a folder, either creates a correlating parent material or finds it, then either creates a correlating material instance more finds it, then adds correlating textures. 
* Worked with environment to set up a file structure and naming convention to organize assets.
* All textures/models are in same folder
