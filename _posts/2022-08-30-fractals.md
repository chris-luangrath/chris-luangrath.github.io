This is another interactable experience for the Footron display wall in the James E. Talmage building at BYU. My professor really liked the [Machina-Infinitum](https://www.machina-infinitum.com/unrealengine) plugin in the Unreal Marketplace, and thought it'd be cool to them off, since the Talmage was also the math building.

To make this, I modified the drone/track system from Fly Around BYU to fit the needs for the Fractal Viewer. These attractions are very similar, except for a few things. In this project, the user needs to be able to:
- Switch fractals (by switching levels in a level select)
- Switch viewing tracks (multiple tracks for each fractals)
- Change fractal parameters (interactable widgets)

# Switching Fractals and Tracks
This was pretty simple, I made a basic level select menu. I was still relatively new to Unreal at this point, so I stored all the data, like level references and preview images, in seperate arrays. Now, I would probably make data objects. It was weird making widgets navigatable with a controller, they're natively accessible with a mouse, but I had to manually map directions to controller axis. It was a whole thing.

Switching Tracks was super easy, I mapped the d-pad to cycle between preset viewing tracks. 

# Changing Fractal Parameters
This was the biggest hurdle I had to solve. After a lot of scouring I found that the parameters for the fractals could be found in their materials. Long story short, I learned how to use Material Collection Parameters, and I hooked some up in the fractal materials. From there, I was able to control material parameters in blueprints, and I made a widget that allowed users to edit fractal parameters in realtime. I was also able to animate fractals by changing a value with a timeline, which could be turned on and off.
