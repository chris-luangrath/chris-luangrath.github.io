In 2020, a BYU grad student, Bryce E. Berrett, flew drones all over BYU's campus to [create a 3d photogrammetric model.](https://magazine.byu.edu/article/3d-byu-campus-tour/)

Then, in 2021, me and my coworker were tasked with making an interactive 
- Similar system to campus fly around (tracks, triggers, targets)
- Can switch targets
- Learned how to control material parameters in blueprints, made widgets to control different parameters for fractals
- Animated Fractals with timeline
- Menu Select
-  Did not know best practice, now I would do differently (data objects for levels/thumbnails)
